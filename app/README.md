# Fungus Friends App
All kinds of funky fungi can be found around SpronQ's office.
This app is built to display them in a nice interactive map.

## How to run
 - first `npm i` in `/app` and then `npm run start`

## Bonus features
 - a custom API (check `/api`)
 - fetching random fungus images
 - you can also search by name
 - you can add your own fungi!
 - you can also delete them!!

## Note
Acces token for unsplash is not included in the repo.
But you can see it working at the live demo :)
